<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>: add the ability to merge bought items into the grocery list.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: This feature represents moving all bought items into the fridge (grocery list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This feature is crucial to the product and user experience; it is a single command solution to merge all the bought shopping items into the grocery list without having to manually add them with multiple <code>glist add</code> commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The feature is able to account for the fact that the fridge (grocery list) may already have items that share the name and expiry date as the bought items.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amount of grocery item is just updated if bought item and grocery item have same name and expiry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bought item is added to the grocery list otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature is able to account for the fact that users do not have to buy exactly as much as they stated in the shopping list.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the user buys more than or equal to the amount stated in the shopping list, the shopping item is removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Else, the shopping item&#8217;s amount is just reduced by the amount bought and bought tag of the shopping item is removed (no bought items left to move to fridge).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature is able to account for different units when adding the quantity of the bought item to the quantity of the grocery item.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grocery item&#8217;s amount is given preference, i.e., the bought item&#8217;s amount&#8217;s unit is converted to match the unit of the grocery item&#8217;s amount.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancement</strong>: add the ability to mark shopping items as urgent.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: This feature adds a red-colored tag 'Urgent!' and moves it to the top of the shopping list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This feature significantly adds to the user experience. All prioritized items are shown at the top of the shopping list to grab the user&#8217;s attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Since a user would not consider an item urgent once they buy their requirements, an item loses its urgent tag once it is completely bought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shopping list is sorted by urgent status first and then alphabetical order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>: display bought status of the amount of shopping item bought along with the shopping item in the UI and move around shopping items in the list according to the amount of each item bought.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: This feature deals with user&#8217;s flexibility of buying any amount of items. This feature also deals with edited amounts of shopping items. The following are the changes that will take place according to a shopping item&#8217;s bought status:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an item is completely bought, the shopping item will get a tag <code>Fully Bought! (&lt;amount bought&gt;)</code> and is <strong>moved to the bottom of the list</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an item is partially bought, the shopping item will get a tag <code>Partially Bought. (&lt;amount bought&gt;)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This feature makes the user experience much more convenient. Since the fully bought items are moved to the bottom of the list and urgent to top, the user will save time by looking at urgent and not bought items at the top of the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For each shopping item the bought list is checked to deduce and display the bought status and bought amount of the shopping item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully bought items are moved to the bottom of the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an urgent item is completely bought, it loses its urgent tag, gets a <code>Fully Bought</code> tag and is moved to the bottom of the shopping list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>: edit shopping items</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: This feature allows the user to edit a shopping item&#8217;s name and amount. This feature is able to deal with several special cases involving units, bought status and urgent status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This feature significantly improves the user experience by dealing with editing wrongly entered items in the ideal way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the name of a shopping item that is partially/fully bought is changed, the names of all the corresponding bought items are changed in order to maintain consistency for the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a fully bought shopping item&#8217;s amount is edited to an amount greater than the bought amount, the item&#8217;s tag changes to 'Partially Bought.' and is accordingly moved up the shopping list.<br>
Similarly, if a partially bought shopping item&#8217;s amount is edited to an amount smaller than or equal to bought amount, the item will be marked as 'Fully Bought!' and lose 'Urgent!' tag if it has one and moves to bottom of the list.<br>
This ensures that the user is not afraid of minor mistakes or changing requirements causing inconsistencies in iFridge.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementations"><a class="link" href="#implementations">Implementations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user is able to merge all the bought shopping items into the grocery list. This can be done with the use of the `slist mergebought' command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current implementation to merge bought items is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For each boughtItem in boughtList:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For each groceryItem in GroceryList</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If there is an existing groceryItem in GroceryList with same name and expiry date as the boughtItem, the quantity of that groceryItem will be updated according to the amount bought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no existing groceryItem with same Name and ExpiryDate, the boughtItem will be added to the GroceryList.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each shoppingItem in ShoppingList find the bought shoppingItem with same name as the boughtItem:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the boughtItem has greater Amount than its corresponding shoppingItem, the shoppingItem is deleted from the ShoppingList.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the boughtItem has lesser Amount than its corresponding shoppingItem, the shoppingItem&#8217;s quantity is just reduced. The shopping item loses its bought tag since there are no bought items that have not been moved to the grocery list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Merge Bought mechanism is facilitated by <code>ShoppingList</code>, <code>GroceryList</code>, and <code>ShoppingComparator</code>.
The <code>ShoppingList</code> is an observable list of <code>ShoppingItem</code> and <code>GroceryList</code> is an observable list of <code>GroceryItem</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merging needs to use the BoughtList to modify the ShoppingList and GroceryList. Hence, the command retrieves the 3 lists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a <code>GroceryItem</code> 's amount is be added, the GroceryItem at that index is overwritten by a new GroceryItem with the updated amount. If a new boughtItem (<code>Groceryitem</code>) is to be added to the <code>GroceryList</code>, it is appended to the <code>GroceryList</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, when a <code>ShoppingItem</code> 's amount is reduced, the ShoppingItem at that index is overwritten by a new ShoppingItem with the updated amount. If a <code>ShoppingItem</code> is to be deleted from the <code>ShoppingList</code>, it is deleted and the <code>ShoppingList</code> is sorted using a <code>ShoppingComparator</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The creation of new objects to replace the existing ones is necessary since all the objects are immutable.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model#getFilteredBoughtList&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Gets <code>ObservableList</code> with the elements of the <code>Model</code> 's boughtList (stored in a <code>GroceryList</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model#getFilteredGroceryList&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Gets <code>ObservableList</code> with the elements of the <code>Model</code> 's <code>GroceryList</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model#getFilteredShoppingList&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Gets <code>ObservableList</code> with the elements of the <code>Model</code> 's <code>ShoppingList</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model#setBoughtList&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Sets the boughtList as the specified <code>GroceryList</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model#sortShoppingItems&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Sorts the <code>ShoppingList</code> by urgent status first, and then by alphabetical order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MergeShoppingCommand#modifyGroceryListAccordingToBoughtItem&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Updates <code>GroceryList</code> according to a boughtItem</p>

<p>The conversions of units are done by <code>Amount</code> class. Unit type is necessary in the implementation to allow for keeping track of different unit groups. For example, <code>kg</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>lbs</code>, and <code>oz</code> are all categorised under the unit type <code>Weight</code>.</p>
