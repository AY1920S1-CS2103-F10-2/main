== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability for the user to keep track of his or her *food wastage statistics*

** What it does: This feature allows the user to keep track of all previous food waste up to the current point.
Some notable extensions include generating a food waste report which showcases a historical trend of food waste by
specifying a time frame, as well as predicting the user's estimated food waste for the current month.

** Justification: This feature improves our product significantly because by allowing the user to monitor his or her
food waste, the user will be encouraged to find effective ways to reduce food waste.

** Highlights: The enhancement required an in-depth planning on how to store the past food waste. This is because there is a need to keep track of the temporal aspects of the
food waste (in particular, when the food was wasted). To facilitate the implementation of this feature, the architecture of some components have to be newly designed from scratch,
and the multiple options to do so had to be carefully considered and assessed. To do so, there is a need to acquire a deep and broad understanding of how the different components
worked together.

* *Minor enhancement*: tbd
