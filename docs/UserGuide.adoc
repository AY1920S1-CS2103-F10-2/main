By: `Team SE-EDU`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, AB3 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `iFridge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all food items in your grocery list
* **`add`**`add n/milk e/23/10/2019 a/1000 u/ml` : adds the food item `milk` to the iFridge application.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/apple t/fruit` or as `n/apple`.
* Items with … after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/fruit`, `t/fruit t/healthy` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/ITEM_NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE`, `e/EXPIRY_DATE n/ITEM_NAME` is also acceptable.

The type of sorting supported is as follows:
****
* Alphabetical: Sort the grocery list in ascending alphabetical order
* Expiry date: Sort the grocery list in ascending expiry date. i.e. from oldest to newest.

moved into the waste list if it has not been fully used (the amount of food remaining > 0).

==== Moving all expired food items from grocery list to waste list

By default, every time the application is launched, Food Orchestra helps you check which items
are expired and automatically moves them into the waste list.

==== Viewing the waste list: `wlist list`

Shows a list of the food items which have been wasted +
Format: `wlist list [m/MONTH_OF_YEAR]` +
****
* If a particular month is specified, the food waste of the particular month will be displayed.
Otherwise, the food waste of the current month is displayed.
* The `MONTH_OF_YEAR` is the natural language month and year expression in English.
To avoid ambiguity, we recommend specifying the month and year in a relaxed date format,
e.g. `Aug 2019`.

****

Examples:

* `wlist list` +
This will list out the current month's waste list.
* `wlist list m/sep 2019` +
This will list out the waste list for the month of September 2019, if such a record exists in our
waste archive (i.e. you have opened our application in the month of September 2019).

==== Displaying food wastage statistics: `wlist report`

Shows a charted report detailing your food wastage statistics across a time frame.
Format: `wlist report [sm/START_MONTH] [em/END_MONTH]`

****
* The report will display 3 charts: kg, litres and units of food wasted per month across the
time frame.

* The dates can be specified in any format permissible by the Natty library. If you only wish to
see your waste report starting 5 months ago, you can consider the command `wlist report sm/5 months ago`.
To avoid ambiguity, you are advised to specify the dates in the relaxed date format (e.g. `Sep 2019`).

[width="100%",cols="^2,^2, 8, 8",options="header"]
|==========================
|Start Month |End Month |Start Month Used |End Month Used
|&#10003; |&#10003;
|The start month follows that specified by the user, or the earliest record found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month follows that specified by the user, or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10003; |&#10007;
|The start month follows that specified by the user, or the earliest record found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month will be one year from the specified start month or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10007; |&#10003;
|The start month will be one year before the end month specified, or the earliest month found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month follows that specified by the user, or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10007; |&#10007;
|The start month would be one year ago from the current month, or the earliest month found in your waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month would be the current month.
|==========================

To illustrate an example, suppose we have a waste archive with waste data from the months of Oct 2018, Nov 2018, ...,
Oct 2019 (the current month). We specify Aug 2018 as a start month and Jun 2019 as an end month, as
shown below:

image::WasteReportTimeFrame.png[]

iFridge will generate the report using all available data within the time period, which will be
Jun 2018 to Jun 2019, highlighted in the yellow box.
****


Examples:

Suppose we have a waste archive with data from Oct 2018 to Oct 2019 (current month).

* `wlist report sm/Mar 2019` +
Generates a waste report from Mar 2019 to the current month of Oct 2019.
* `wlist report sm/Mar 2019 em/Sep 2019` +
Generates a waste report from Mar 2019 to Sep 2019
* `wlist report sm/Mar 2018` +
Generates a waste report from Oct 2018 to Mar 2019 (one year from Mar 2018)
* `wlist report sm/5 months ago` +
Generates a waste report from May 2019 to Oct 2019 (current month)

The allowable date formats can be found in the Natty library documentation.

==== Obtain feedback based on current food wastage: `wlist feedback`

Format: `wlist feedback`
****
Shows the current month’s wastage statistics:

* How many kg, litres, and units wasted so far
* Predicted wastage for the month
* Feedback on how user is managing food waste compared to the average food waste management across the past year
****

Our prediction algorithm: +
We first interpolate your current month's waste statistics to arrive at an estimate. Following which,
we take a weighted average of your waste statistics across the past couple of months to provide you with
a more reliable prediction.

As with any other application, our prediction algorithm will be more accurate with more frequent usage.
