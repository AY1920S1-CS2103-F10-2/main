== Introduction
In order to encourage and facilitate these consumer behaviours that can reduce food waste,
we have designed iFridge, an easy-to-use application that allows users to keep track and manage
their food inventory in the Grocery List feature, generate shopping lists in Shopping List, and
track their food waste and monthly performance in the Waste List feature. We also allow you to
create Template Lists: If you have a list of staple items you wish to maintain in your fridge,
you can store it as a template list so that you can generate a shopping list based on what is
currently missing from your pantry. +

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `glist add n/ITEM_NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE a/AMOUNT`, `ITEM_NAME`, `EXPIRY_DATE`, and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `glist add n/apple e/23/10/2019 a/3units`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `glist add n/NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE a/AMOUNT [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/apple e/23/10/2019 a/3units t/fruit` or as `n/apple e/23/10/2019 a/3units`.
* Items with … after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/fruit`, `t/fruit t/healthy` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/ITEM_NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE`, `e/EXPIRY_DATE n/ITEM_NAME` is also acceptable.
====

====
*About the Amount Parameter*

* The iFridge app allows for some flexibility with the units inputted with the amount. The following units are accepted this application:
ml, L, oz, lbs, kg, g, units.
* Several commands involve computation of amounts. Units are classified under three unit types:
- *Volume:* ml, L
- *Quantity:* units
- *Weight:* g, kg, oz, lbs
* When adding or editing items, the system will only allow items with similar names (checking is non-case-sensitive) to have similar unit types. However,
the adding of items with conflicting unit types will not be allowed.
====

Upon exiting the app, updated lists will be automatically saved.


==== Reminder settings: `glist remDefault`
Change default number of days (n) which grocery item is expiring in,
to colour code grocery items based on expiry dates. +
-*red* = has expired +

Clearing of waste list is done automatically at the start of every month.

=== Grocery List Management

==== Adding a food item: `glist add`

Adds a grocery item to the grocery list. +
Format: `glist add n/ITEM_NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE a/AMOUNT [t/TAG]`

****
* `e/EXPIRY_DATE` must follow the format `dd/MM/yyyy`.
* `a/AMOUNT` must have a magnitude i.e. measurable quantity. Magnitude and unit can be separated by a space.
* There may be more than one tag field.
* The input fields can be in any order.
* Item with *either same name or expiry date* as the existing ones can be added.
* Items with *same name and expiry date* as the existing ones cannot be added.
****

Examples:

Add tea of quantity 200 ml, tagged as "fresh" and "drink" and expiring on 18 October 2019.

==== Listing all grocery items: `glist list`

Shows a list of grocery items in the grocery list. +
Format: `glist list`

==== Deleting a grocery item: `glist delete`

Deletes the specified grocery item from the grocery list when it is done being used.
If the amount of the food item left > 0, the item will be moved to the waste list. +
Format: `glist delete INDEX`

==== Use a grocery item: `glist use`

Reduces the amount left of a grocery item by the specified amount. +
Format: `glist use INDEX a/AMOUNT`

****
* The system only recognises metric units. e.g. kilogram, liter. The system does not support unrecognised units such as tablespoon (not precise), and pint (not a metric unit).
* Only the units in the following unit categories are supported:
** `Weight`: `kg`, `g`, `oz`, `lbs`
** `Volume`: `L`, `ml`
** `Quantity`: `units`
* Whitespace between magnitude and unit is allowed.
* Cross conversion between units of the same categories is supported.
** If the unit of input amount is different from the unit of item, the resultant amount would follow the unit of the original item. e.g. If an item of `1kg` is used by `300g`, it would become `0.7kg` and not `700g`.
****

Examples:

* `glist use 2 a/300g` +
Reduces the amount of 2nd item by 300 grams.
* `glist use 3 a/5 L` +
Reduces the amount of 3rd item by 5 liters.

==== Edit a grocery item: `glist edit`

Edits an existing item in the grocery list. +
Format: `glist edit INDEX [n/ITEM_NAME] [e/EXPIRY_DATE] [t/TAG]`

****
* Edits an item at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the number shown in the displayed list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional field must be provided.
* Amount cannot be edited, but can only be modified through `use`.
* Existing values will be updated to input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the item will be removed. i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the item's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `glist edit 1 n/Fuji apple t/healthy` +
Edits the name and tag of the 1st item to be `Fuji apple` and `healthy` respectively.
* `glist edit 2 n/Olive oil t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd item to `Olive oil` and clears all existing tags.

==== Sort the grocery list: `glist sort`

Sorts the grocery list based on the type of sorting. +
Format: `glist sort by/TYPE` +

Sorting is done on the original grocery list. Hence, for example, when `sort` is done after `find`, both the resultant `find` list and the original list will be sorted.

The type of sorting supported is as follows:
****
* Alphabetical: Sort the grocery list in ascending alphabetical order
* Expiry date: Sort the grocery list in ascending expiry date. i.e. from oldest to newest.
****

Examples:

* `glist sort by/alphabetical`

* Only full words will be matched e.g. `appl` will not match `apple`
* Grocery items matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. it uses an `OR` search). e.g. `apple dinner` will return `Apple juice`, `Pizza` tagged with `dinner`, and `Apple pie` tagged with `dinner`.
****

=== Waste List Management

==== Moving an item into waste list

When you delete an item from your grocery list using `delete`, the item will automatically be
moved into the waste list if it has not been fully used (the amount of food remaining > 0).

==== Viewing the waste list: `wlist list`

Shows a list of the food items which have been wasted +
Format: `wlist list [m/MONTH_OF_YEAR]` +
****
* If a particular month is specified, the food waste of the particular month will be displayed.
Otherwise, the food waste of the current month is displayed.
* The `MONTH_OF_YEAR` is the natural language month and year expression in English.
To avoid ambiguity, we recommend specifying the month and year in a relaxed date format,
e.g. `Aug 2019`.

****

Examples:

* `wlist list` +
This will list out the current month's waste list.
* `wlist list m/sep 2019` +
This will list out the waste list for the month of September 2019, if such a record exists in our
waste archive (i.e. you have opened our application in the month of September 2019).

==== Displaying food wastage statistics: `wlist report`

Shows a charted report detailing your food wastage statistics across a time frame.
Format: `wlist report [sm/START_MONTH] [em/END_MONTH]`

****
* The report will display 3 charts: kg, litres and units of food wasted per month across the
time frame.

* The dates can be specified in any format permissible by the Natty library. If you only wish to
see your waste report starting 5 months ago, you can consider the command `wlist report sm/5 months ago`.
To avoid ambiguity, you are advised to specify the dates in the relaxed date format (e.g. `Sep 2019`).

[width="100%",cols="^2,^2, 8, 8",options="header"]
|==========================
|Start Month |End Month |Start Month Used |End Month Used
|&#10003; |&#10003;
|The start month follows that specified by the user, or the earliest record found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month follows that specified by the user, or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10003; |&#10007;
|The start month follows that specified by the user, or the earliest record found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month will be one year from the specified start month or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10007; |&#10003;
|The start month will be one year before the end month specified, or the earliest month found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month follows that specified by the user, or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10007; |&#10007;
|The start month would be one year ago from the current month, or the earliest month found in your waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month would be the current month.
|==========================

To illustrate an example, suppose we have a waste archive with waste data from the months of Oct 2018, Nov 2018, ...,
Oct 2019 (the current month). We specify Aug 2018 as a start month and Jun 2019 as an end month, as
shown below:

image::WasteReportTimeFrame.png[]

iFridge will generate the report using all available data within the time period, which will be
Oct 2018 to Jun 2019, highlighted in the yellow box.
****


Examples:

Suppose we have a waste archive with data from Oct 2018 to Oct 2019 (current month).

* `wlist report sm/Mar 2019` +
Generates a waste report from Mar 2019 to the current month of Oct 2019.
* `wlist report sm/Mar 2019 em/Sep 2019` +
Generates a waste report from Mar 2019 to Sep 2019
* `wlist report sm/Mar 2018` +
Generates a waste report from Oct 2018 to Mar 2019 (one year from Mar 2018)
* `wlist report sm/5 months ago` +
Generates a waste report from May 2019 to Oct 2019 (current month)

The allowable date formats can be found in the Natty library documentation.

====
*Using the waste report*

* After a successful waste report command, there will be 3 charts displayed in different tabs, one for each of the following:

** Weight of food wasted (in kg) across the time frame
** Volume of food wasted (in litres) across the time frame
** Quantity of food wasted (in units) across the time frame

Our charts are interactive, you can get more details about your food wastage by interacting with our charts.

* Zooming on the chart: If you want to zoom in on a specific region of the graph, you can use your mouse to click and drag on the
preferred window.
* To retrieve more specific details on the food wastage for a particular month, you can choose to:
** click on the particular point in the chart, which will bring up the grid guidelines, or
** click on the month name in the horizontal axis, which will zoom in on the exact wastage details for that particular month.
* Returning to the original window: You can easily return to the original window by clicking on the title of the chart.

Below is an example of a waste report with the chart on food wastage in kg:

image::WasteReportWindow.png[]

_By clicking on the data point which lies on "March 2019", we can see that our food wastage for Mar 2019 is around 0.45kg._
====

==== Obtain feedback based on current food wastage: `wlist feedback`

Format: `wlist feedback`
****
Shows the current month’s wastage statistics:

* How many kg, litres, and units wasted so far
* Predicted wastage for the month
* Feedback on how user is managing food waste compared to the average food waste management across the past year
****

Our prediction algorithm: +
We first interpolate your current month's waste statistics to arrive at an estimate. Following which,
we take a weighted average of your waste statistics across the past couple of months to provide you with
a more reliable prediction.

As with any other application, our prediction algorithm will be more accurate with more frequent usage.
